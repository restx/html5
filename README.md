# HTML5 boilerplate seed for restx

This is a template for a HTML5 web client, as generated by yeoman html5 generator, with sources in the app directory to follow usual convention.

This template doesn't require any additional tool, just edit the sources and refresh your browser like in good old days.

To call RESTX endpoints, you can use [jQuery ajax](http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/), like for instance [`$.getJSON`](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/).
